## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/study_planner.git
cd study_planner
```

### 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies.
- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root to manage your environment-specific settings (such as secret keys, debug settings, and database configurations). For example:
```dotenv
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
STUDY_PLANNER_ENV=development
```
> **Note:** Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data from being committed.

### 5. Run Migrations
Apply database migrations to set up your database schema:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a Superuser
Set up an admin account to manage the application:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Then, you can log in to the admin dashboard at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/).

### 7. Start the Development Server
Launch the application locally:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser to start using the app.
